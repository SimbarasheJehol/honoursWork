# Parallel _k_-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

Input
A input file _test_big.txt_ contains coordinates of 9271 _3D_-points in the world space.

Output
For each input point, find its _k_-nearest neighbors indexes. 

Build and run
To build use Makefile (C++11 needed)
Run the following commands

make

./main ./input/test_big.txt ./out/out_big.txt
